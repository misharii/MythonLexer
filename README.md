# MythonLexer

A JFlex-based lexer for the Mython programming language.

## Overview

This project implements a lexical analyzer for the Mython programming language using JFlex. It recognizes tokens such as keywords, operators, identifiers, punctuation, and integer literals.

## Project Structure

- `MythonLexer.flex`: The JFlex specification file defining the lexer.
- `MythonLexer.java`: The Java file generated by JFlex.
- `TestLexer.java`: A Java program to test the lexer.

## test 
on this fragment code:
`def fib(x) = if x = 1 then 0 else
             if x = 2 then 1 else
             fib(x - 1) + fib(x - 2)
`

Output:
`Recognized Keyword: def
Recognized Identifier: fib
Recognized Punctuation: (
Recognized Identifier: x
Recognized Punctuation: )
Recognized Operator: =
Recognized Keyword: if
Recognized Identifier: x
Recognized Operator: =
Recognized Integer Literal: 1
Recognized Keyword: then
Recognized Integer Literal: 0
Recognized Keyword: else
Recognized Keyword: if
Recognized Identifier: x
Recognized Operator: =
Recognized Integer Literal: 2
Recognized Keyword: then
Recognized Integer Literal: 1
Recognized Keyword: else
Recognized Identifier: fib
Recognized Punctuation: (
Recognized Identifier: x
Recognized Operator: -
Recognized Integer Literal: 1
Recognized Punctuation: )
Recognized Operator: +
Recognized Identifier: fib
Recognized Punctuation: (
Recognized Identifier: x
Recognized Operator: -
Recognized Integer Literal: 2
Recognized Punctuation: )
Reached EOF
Reached the End of File.

## Usage



### Generating the Lexer

Run JFlex to generate the `MythonLexer.java` file:

```bash
jflex MythonLexer.flex
